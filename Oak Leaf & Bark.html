    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
    <h4>Southern Red Oak, also called southern red oak, spanish oak, bottomland red oak, or three-lobed red oak, is native to the southeastern United States.</h4>
    <h4>It gets its name the "Spanish Oak" as these are the areas of early Spanish colonies, whilst "southern red oak" comes from both its range and leaf color during late summer and fall.</h4>
    <h4>The southern red oak is a deciduous angiosperm, so it has leaves that die after each growing period and come back in the next period of growth.</h4>
