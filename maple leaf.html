<h1>Unidentified Leaves</h1>
    <h2>***NOTE***</h2> 
    <h4>Red maple resembles this type of leaf closest,</h4>
    <h4>so I'll assume that this leaf (the brown and red leaves) are maple leaves that changed color due to the change in season.</h4>
    <h2>Fun Facts (Assuming it's a Red Maple leaf):</h2>
    <h3>Scientic Name:</h3>
    <h4>Acer Rubrum</h4>
    <h3>Other Facts:</h3>
    <h4>Red Maple, also known as swamp maple, water maple, or soft maple, is one of the most common and widespread deciduous trees of eastern and central North America.</h4>
    <h4>The U.S. Forest Service recognizes it as the most abundant native tree in eastern North America.</h4>
    <h4>The red maple ranges from southeastern Manitoba around the Lake of the Woods on the border with Ontario and Minnesota, east to Newfoundland, south to Florida, and southwest to East Texas.</h4>
    <h4>Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form.</h4>
    <h4>Its flowers, petioles, twigs, and seeds are all red to varying degrees.</h4>
    <h4>Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.</h4>
