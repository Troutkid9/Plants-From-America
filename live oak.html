    <h1>Live Oak (Evergreen Oak)</h1>
    <h3>Scientific Name:</h3> 
    <h4>Quercus Virginiana</h4>
    <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
    <h4>Live oak (or evergreen oak) is any of a number of oaks in several different sections of the genus Quercus that share the characteristic of evergreen foliage.</h4>
    <h4>The name live oak comes from the fact that evergreen oaks remain green and "live" throughout winter, when other oaks are dormant and leafless.</h4>
    <h4>The name is used mainly in North America, where evergreen oaks are widespread in warmer areas along the Atlantic coast from southeast Virginia to Florida, west along the Gulf Coast to Louisiana and Mexico, and across the southwest to California.</h4>
    <h4>Evergreen oak species are also common in parts of southern Europe and south Asia, and are included in this list for the sake of completeness.</h4>
